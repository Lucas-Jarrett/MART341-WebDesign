# How my semester has been going #
## By Lucas Jarrett ##

This semester has been somewhat tough for me so far. Which is a problem leading with the fact that we're almost **half way through already** and I'm doing work from **week three.**  But such is the way these things go. I would like to thank you for allowing me to turn all these assignments in late. Web design wasn't something I had on my agenda but is a welcome return to coding that I had missed in recent history. The only troubling part is seeing work like this dissapear to the likes of *Wix* or *Canva*, or even A.I. for that matter. But as far as the work for this class goes, things have been good. And I can't wait to see what comes next for me. And I hope to be able to finish it in a timely manner. Hopefully.

## Here is a list of recent movies I've watched ##
### Not entirely sure how long this has been but *"Recent History"* at least
- Moneyball
- Buzz Lightyear of Star Command
- Coco
- Mission Impossible: Fallout
- Night of the Living Dead
- Broadcast News
- A Few Good Men
- The Judge

Heres a cool website I found. I recently went back and found the original winamp and ended up finding this cool archive of a bunch of skins for the program.

And finally, a photo from this week with my friend for scale of the icicles on our apartment.
